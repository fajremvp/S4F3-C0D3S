**S4F3-C0D3S** is a secure, encrypted, offline, cloud-free, free, no subscription, open-source, no data collection, cross-platform, and portable recovery code manager (2FA).

---

## üí° The Idea
- **S4F3-C0D3S** was born from a real and personal need to securely store recovery codes (2FA). Often, we end up saving this sensitive information in **notepads**, **screenshots**, **photographs**, or **unprotected files**, which compromises our digital security.
- While password managers like **Bitwarden** or **KeePass** are very popular and effective for storing credentials, the saying **"don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket"** reminds us that it‚Äôs important to separate different types of sensitive data, such as 2FA recovery codes. With **S4F3-C0D3S**, you can store this information in a dedicated encrypted vault, avoiding the risk of compromising multiple layers of security at once.
